        <article class="my_story">
          My earliest memory of coding goes back to elementary school,
          writing commands on an Apple computer to draw pictures using a grid structure.
          It wasn't until the MySpace era that I started exploring the world of HTML and all its glory.
          As Facebook emerged, it was the end of MySpace and HTML exploration.
          Then came college. I took intro programming courses (Java, C++, Visual Basic) as part of my curriculum.
          With each completed assignment I felt a great sense of satisfaction. And that was the direction I wanted my career to go.
          Unfortunately, finding a job post-college was difficult. So I took whatever job came along.
          And now, thanks to Udacity and Google, here I am. Second chance to pursue my passion.
